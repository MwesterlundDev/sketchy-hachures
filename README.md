# sketchy-hachures

A variation on [drawing shaded relief in the browser](https://github.com/awoodruff/canvas-shaded-relief), using angled strokes kind of like hachures. Code is all in `index.html`. Further explanation and examples are [on my blog](http://andywoodruff.com/blog/hachures-and-sketchy-relief-maps/).
